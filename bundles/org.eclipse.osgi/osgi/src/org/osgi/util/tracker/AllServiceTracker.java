/**
 * The <tt>AllServiceTracker</tt> class simplifies using services from the
 * Framework's service registry.
 * <p>
 * A <tt>AllServiceTracker</tt> object is constructed with search criteria and a
 * <tt>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</tt> object. A <tt>AllServiceTracker</tt>
 * object can use the <tt>ServiceTrackerCustomizer</tt> object to customize
 * the service objects to be tracked. The <tt>ServiceTracker</tt> object can
 * then be opened to begin tracking all services in the Framework's service
 * registry that match the specified search criteria. The
 * <tt>ServiceTracker</tt> object correctly handles all of the details of
 * listening to <tt>ServiceEvent</tt> objects and getting and ungetting
 * services.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>getServiceReferences</tt> method can be called to get references to
 * the services being tracked. The <tt>getService</tt> and
 * <tt>getServices</tt> methods can be called to get the service objects for
 * the tracked service.
