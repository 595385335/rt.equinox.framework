/**
 * File managers provide a facility for tracking the state of files being used and updated by several
 * systems at the same time. The typical usecase is in shared configuration data areas.
 * <p>
 * The general principle is to maintain a table which maps user-level file name
 * onto actual disk file. The filename is actually never used, and the file is always stored under the
 * given filename suffixed by an integer. If a file needs to be modified, it is written into a new file whose name suffix 
 * is incremented.
 * Once the instance has been created, open() must be called before performing any other operation.
 * On open the fileManager starts by reading the current table and
 * thereby obtaining a snapshot of the current directory state. If another
 * entity updates the directory, the file manager is able to detect the change.
 * Given that the file is unique, if another entity used the file manager mechanism, the file manager can
 * still access the state of the file as it was when the file manager first started.
 * <p>
 * The facilities provided here are cooperative. That is, all participants must
 * agree to the conventions and to calling the given API. There is no capacity
 * to enforce these conventions or prohibit corruption.
 * </p>
